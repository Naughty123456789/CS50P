#### Description:
I have decided to create a Tic Tac Toe game where players have to try to get 3 in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 
Initially , i experimented trying with 2D arrays as i had learned it before in java but i realised that 
i can actually create a Tic Tac Toe game by using dictionary and strings in python. This project is more for me to 
learn deeper about the basic syntaxes of python as functions like dictionary does not seem to be available in java ( at least so far in my coding experience)

Maybe i could have tried to dabble more into 2D arrays for python?

In this project, I have also tried to include more possibilities that could have happened from the user's perspective.

The possibility of users putting in the wrong values or inputting positions that has already been filled is accounted for. 
The possiblity of a tie is also accounted for in this game. 
I also included a quit button for users to exit the game whenever they like so as to make the game more interactive for the users.

The test cases here were a challenge becauses the grid here is constantly changing - its not static so it is difficult to test each function clearly and throughly. 
Hence , for my test cases,  i have decided to utilise simple test cases instead.

It was also difficult for me to create the grid for the tic tat toe as i was very use to representing such templates in a 2D array instead. 
Hence, through multiple experimentation only did I realise that I could have used dictionary and string to achieve my objective. 
Relearning python again after not touching it for a few months was proved to be a challenge for me as I vaguely remember the basic syntax. 
However, through this project, I feel that my mastery of the python language has significantly improved. 
Re-watching the online lectures has proven to be very useful for me in creating this game in python.

What i truly enjoyed in this project is the mental challenges i faced while doing it. 
Creating this game has required me to think of possible ways to best represent this game. 
It truly gets me thinking, getting out of my comfort zone, asking my peers how could i have better improve/implement a certain feature in the game. 
It was a difficult journey completing CS50p and this Tic Tac Toe game but it was definitely fulfilling and 
i would definitely recommend this to my peers who are seeking to equip themselves with coding skills

This project has allowed me to gain further insights into the technicalities involved in a game. 
Even simple games such as tic tac toe require a deeper depth and technicalities in programming. 
The need to take account of a variety of test cases is also essential to ensure a more interactive and fun experience for the users.
