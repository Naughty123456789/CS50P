    #### Description:
    I have decided to create a Tic Tac Toe game where players have to try to get 3 in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Initially , i experimented trying with 2D arrays as i had learned it before in java but i realised that i can actually create a Tic Tac Toe game by using dictionary and strings in python. This project is more for me to learn deeper about the basic syntaxes of python as functions like dictionary does not seem to be available in java ( at least so far in my coding experience)

    Maybe i could have tried to dabble more into 2D arrays for python?

    i am going to show you this game :^)
